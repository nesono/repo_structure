# Creating a New Release

Simple check list to go through for creating a new release

- [ ] Create PR with updated version strings with new version string, e.g.
      search and replace all occurrences of v0.3.4
- [ ] Merge PR
- [ ] Create new release on GitHub (with the new tag)

Important to note is that the time between merging the PR with the new release
version and the creation of the new release should be minimal.
